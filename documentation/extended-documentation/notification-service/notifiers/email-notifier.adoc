= Email Notifier

_Since Payara Server 4.1.1.171_

Payara Server is able to direct notifications from the
link:/documentation/extended-documentation/notification-service/notification-service.adoc[Notification service]
to a single given email address.

[[requirements]]
== Requirements

* A valid, configured `JavaMail` session.

[[configuration]]
== Configuration

At a high level, the steps to configure the email notifier are:

. Create a `JavaMail` Session
. Create the notifier using the `asadmin` command or through the Admin Console

[[email-notifier-configuration]]
== Email Notifier Configuration

You will need a `JavaMail` session to send the notifications; instructions
on setting up a `JavaMail` session can be found
link:/documentation/core-documentation/javamail.adoc[in the core documentation].

The email notifier is configured in the **Email** tab of the Notification
Section of the server's instance configuration.

On the Email tab there are four fields:

`Enabled`::
Determines whether the notifier should be activated.
`Dynamic`::
Sets whether the notifier will be enabled without a restart, `true`
enables it immediately, while `false` requires a restart.
`jndiName`:: 3
Sets the name of the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) of the
configured `JavaMail` session.
`to`::
Sets the email address which will receive the email notifications. Currently
only one address can be specified.

The same configuration can be set using an `asadmin` command, as shown below:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin notification-email-configure --jndiName=mail/exampleEmailNotifier --to=notifications@example.com --enabled=true --dynamic=true
----

To check the currently applied configuratio, you can run the following `asadmin`
command:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin get-email-notifier-configuration
----

It will return the current configuration of the email notifier in full detail;
including whether it is enabled, the recipient address, and the JNDI name of
the current JavaMail session in use.

Here is an example output:

[source, shell]
----
$ asadmin get-email-notifier-configuration

Enabled  JNDI Name                  To
true     mail/exampleEmailNotifier  example@example.com
----
