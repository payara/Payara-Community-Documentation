= Clustering with Payara Server

Payara Micro can cluster with Payara Server and share web session and JCache data.

To cluster with Payara Server, just start a Payara Micro instance with the same
Hazelcast cluster configuration as configured in your Payara Server (e.g. multicast
  address, multicast port, cluster name, and cluster password).

When Payara Server DAS is connected to the same Hazelcast cluster, the Admin
console can display the details about Payara Micro instances in the cluster.
See link:/documentation/payara-server/hazelcast/viewing-members.adoc[Viewing Cluster Members]
section for details.
