=== Incompatibility with the latest JVM / JDK versions and Monitoring
IMPORTANT: Payara Platform products do run correctly on JDK 8u292+ and 11.0.11+ due to the removal of SSL/TLS  1.0 and SSL/TLS 1.1 protocols in these versions. The JMX service doesn't start properly which means there are no monitoring data available.
