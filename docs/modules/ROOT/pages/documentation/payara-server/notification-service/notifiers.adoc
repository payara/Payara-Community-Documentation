= Notifiers

The notification service comes with an integrated set of notifiers that
can be used to send notification events to a distinct variety of
channels apart from the standard server log mechanism:

*JMS*:: Taking advantage of preconfigured JMS connection resources, you
can route notifications to a Java Message Queue so it can be consumed by
other applications or services
*CDI Event Bus*:: For sending notification events using xref:/documentation/payara-server/public-api/cdi-events.adoc[Payara's CDI Event Bus]
 and observing them in instances in the cluster.

TIP: Payara Platform Enterprise provides additional link:{enterpriseDocsPageRootUrl}/documentation/payara-server/notification-service/notifiers.html[Notifiers] (New Relic, DataDog, Email and more). These are very helpful for Operations to send notifications to 3rd party tools to monitor how the Payara Platform runtimes are doing.

Appropriate instructions on how to configure and use all of these
notification mechanisms are included in this section.
