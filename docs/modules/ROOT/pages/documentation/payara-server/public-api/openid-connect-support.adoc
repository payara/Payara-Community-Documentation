[[openid-connect-support]]
= OpenID Connect Support

_Since Payara Server 4.1.2.183 and 5.183_

The Payara API provides a `@OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition` annotation that creates an authorization mechanism for OpenID Connect support. 
This works in the same way as other authorization mechanisms in the Java EE Security API.

[[usage]]
== Usage

The OpenID Connect authentication mechanism is defined through the `@OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition` annotation. 
Specifying this in a valid place as defined by the Java EE Security API will create the mechanism. 
Often this may mean that any class is a valid position.

[[usage-example]]
=== Example

Here's an example that configures a OpenID Connect client:

[source, java]
----
@OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition(
       providerURI = "https://sample-openid-server.com",
       clientId = "87068hgfg5675htfv6mrucov57bknst.apps.sample.com",
       clientSecret = "{my-secret}",
       redirectURI = "${baseURL}/callback",
       extraParameters = {
            "testKey=testValue",
            "testKey2=testValue2"
       }
)
public class SecurityBean {

}
----

See https://github.com/javaee-samples/vendoree-samples/tree/master/payara/openid[this sample project] for a more detailed example.

When defining a OpenID Connect flow within an application deployed on Payara Server, 
it is possible to retrieve the access token, identity token, user claims and the other authentication information within any bean in the scope of the callback/redirectURI resource used to configure the authentication:

[source, java]
----
@WebServlet("/callback")
public class CallbackServlet extends HttpServlet {
    
    @Inject
    OpenIdContext context;
    
    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
        //Here's the caller name
        out.println(context.getCallerName());
        //Here's the caller groups
        out.println(context.getCallerGroups());
        //Here's the unique subject identifier within the issuer
        out.println(context.getSubject());
        //Here's the access token
        out.println(context.getAccessToken());
        //Here's the identity token
        out.println(context.getIdentityToken());
        //Here's the user claims
        out.println(context.getClaimsJson());
    }
}
----

_Since Payara Server 5.2020.5_

The original protected URL called is stored so that a redirect can be issued to this page after the callback from the OpenIdConnect provider is handled.  

NOTE: Only some basic redirect is supported namely a GET. Only the URL and query parameters are available, not the headers and the request body.

[source, java]
----

    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        // handling the OpenIdContext information. See previous example
        // Now return to original requested page
        response.sendRedirect(request.getSession().getAttribute(OpenIdConstant.ORIGINAL_REQUEST).toString());
    }
----

[[configuration]]
== Configuration

OpenID Client can be configured with both `@OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition` annotation attributes and Microprofile Config properties.

CAUTION: When you provide configuration using MicroProfile Config properties and you use a reference to a variable provided by Payara using the `${}` notation inside the values, you need to escape the `$` sign with `\\`. Otherwise they will be treated as references to other MicroProfile Config properties, which may result in an error if such a MicroProfie property isn't found. This especially applies to the `baseURL` variable, which is only accepted in the value of the `redirectURI` option. For example, to specify `redirectURI` using a MicroProfile Config property which is equal to `${baseURL}/Callback` used in the annotation, you need to use the following MicroProfile Config key=value definition: `payara.security.openid.redirectURI=\\${baseURL}/Callback`.

The annotation and MicroProfile properties has several configuration options.
They are detailed below.

|
| 
|===

*Note :* If both an annotation attribute and a MicroProfile Config property are defined for the same option 
then the MicroProfile Config property value always takes precedence over the `@OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition` annotation value.

[[el-support]]
=== Expression Language Support

Additionally, the `@OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition` supports the use of expression language (EL) notation for dynamic configuration scenarios. 
This means that you can use any CDI bean properties to set the OpenID Connect configuration like this:

[source, java]
----
@OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition(
    providerURI="#{openidConfigBean.tokenEndpointURL}",
    clientId="#{openidConfigBean.clientId}",
    clientSecret="#{openidConfigBean.clientSecret}",
    redirectURI="#{openidConfigBean.redirectURI}"
)
public class SecurityBean {
}
----

[[logout]]
=== Logout functionality
_Since 5.2020.3_

With the `logout` parameter of the `OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition` you can define the behavior when the user logs out of the application and defines how the RP session is managed.

.Configuration Options
|===
| Option | MP Config property | Required | Description | Default value 

| `notifyProvider`
| payara.security.openid.provider.notify.logout
| false
| Notify the OIDC provider (OP) that the user has logged out of
    the application and might want to log out of the OP as well. If true then
    after having logged out the user from RP, redirects the End-User's User
    Agent to the OP's logout endpoint URL. This URL is normally obtained via
    the `end_session_endpoint` element of the OP's metadata or can be
    customized via `fish.payara.security.annotations.OpenIdProviderMetadata#endSessionEndpoint`
| false

| `redirectURI`
| payara.security.openid.logout.redirectURI
| false
| The post logout redirect URI to which the RP is requesting that
   the End-User's User Agent be redirected after a logout has been
   performed. If redirect URI is empty then redirect to OpenID connect
  provider _authorization_endpoint_ for re-authentication.
| 

| `accessTokenExpiry`
| payara.security.openid.logout.access.token.expiry
| false
| Whether the application session times out when the Access Token expires.
| false 

| `identityTokenExpiry`
| payara.security.openid.logout.identity.token.expiry
| false
| Whether the application session times out when the Identity Token expires.
| false


|===

A programmatic logout is performed by calling `OpenIdContext#logout()` which invalidates the RP's active OpenId Connect session. If `fish.payara.security.annotations.LogoutDefinition#notifyProvider` is set to true then it redirects the End-User's User Agent to the `end_session_endpoint` to notify the OP that the user has logged out of the RP's application. It will also ask the user whether they want to logout from the OP as well. After successful logout, the End-User's User Agent redirects back to the RP's `_post_redirect_uri_` configured via `fish.payara.security.annotations.LogoutDefinition#redirectURI`.



[[secret-alias]]
=== Client Secret Aliasing

The client secret can be input directly, or for added security it can be aliased using any of the following features:

- xref:/documentation/payara-server/password-aliases/README.adoc[Password Aliases]
- xref:/documentation/payara-server/server-configuration/var-substitution/README.adoc[Environment Variables / System Properties]
- xref:/documentation/microprofile/config/README.adoc[Config API]

[[fetch-caller-data]]
=== Fetch Caller Data
As OpenId Connect Client is built on top of Jakarta EE Security API,
therefore `javax.security.enterprise.SecurityContext` interface can provide 
caller info which is available as a CDI bean and can be injected into any context-aware instance.

The Payara API also provides a `fish.payara.security.openid.api.OpenIdContext` 
interface which is also available as a CDI bean and consist of the following methods:

- The `getCallerName()` method - Gets the caller name of the currently authenticated user.
- The `getCallerGroups()` method - Gets the groups associated with the caller.
- The `getSubject()` method - Subject Identifier. A locally unique and never 
reassigned identifier within the Issuer for the End-User, which is intended to 
be consumed by the Client.
- The `getTokenType()` method - Gets the token type value. The value MUST be 
Bearer or another token_type value that the Client has negotiated with the 
Authorization Server. 
- The `getAccessToken()` method - Gets the authorization token that was received from the OpenId Connect provider.
- The `getIdentityToken()` method - Gets the identity token that was received from the OpenId Connect provider.
- The `getRefreshToken()` method - Returns the refresh token that is used by OIDC client to get a new access token.
- The `getExpiresIn()` method - Return the time that the access token is granted for, if it is set to expire.
- The `getClaimsJson()` method - Gets the User Claims JSON that was received from the userinfo endpoint.
- The `getClaims()` method - Gets the User Claims that were received from the userinfo endpoint.
- The `getProviderMetadata()` method - The OpenId Connect Provider's metadata document fetched via provider URI.

[[google-oidc-integration]]
=== Google integration

The Payara API provides the in-built support for Google OpenID Provider via the `@GoogleAuthenticationDefinition` annotation.

==== Request Refresh Token
To enable the refresh token feature, set the `tokenAutoRefresh` to true 
and add the `access_type` parameter value to `offline`
so that application can refresh access tokens when the user is not present at the browser. 

If application requests `offline` access then the application can receive access and refresh token. 
Once the application has a refresh token, it can obtain a new access token at any time or as older ones expire.
Otherwise, If application requests `online` access, your application will only receive an access token

[source, java]
----
@GoogleAuthenticationDefinition(
    providerURI="#{openidConfigBean.tokenEndpointURL}",
    clientId="#{openidConfigBean.clientId}",
    clientSecret="#{openidConfigBean.clientSecret}",
    ...
    tokenAutoRefresh = true,
    extraParameters = {"access_type=offline", "approval_prompt=force"}
)
public class SecurityBean {
}
----

[[azure-ad-oidc-integration]]
=== Azure AD integration

The Payara API also provides the in-built support for Azure AD OpenID Provider via the `@AzureAuthenticationDefinition` annotation.

==== Request Refresh Token
To receive the refresh token, set the `tokenAutoRefresh` to true and explicitly add the `offline_access` scope to the definition.

[source, java]
----
@AzureAuthenticationDefinition(
    providerURI="#{openidConfigBean.tokenEndpointURL}",
    clientId="#{openidConfigBean.clientId}",
    clientSecret="#{openidConfigBean.clientSecret}",
    ...
    tokenAutoRefresh = true,
    scope = {OPENID_SCOPE, EMAIL_SCOPE, PROFILE_SCOPE, OFFLINE_ACCESS_SCOPE}
)
public class SecurityBean {
}
----


==== Groups mapping

- To add the groups to the registered application, Sign in to the Azure portal > Azure Active Directory > Manage > App registrations > select your application:
image:security-connector/oidc/azure/app_registrations.png[Select application]

- You may also add the custom roles via **Roles and administrators** under the **Manage** section:
image:security-connector/oidc/azure/custom_role.png[Add Custom Roles]

- Now to map group claims, select **Token configuration** under the **Manage** section:
image:security-connector/oidc/azure/token_configuration.png[Token configuration]

- Press **Add groups claim** button to select group types and customize Id and/or Access token properties:
image:security-connector/oidc/azure/add_groups_claim.png[Add Groups Claim]

- Groups claim can also be defined via Azure **Manifest** under the **Manage** section which is a JSON configuration file.

- To retrieve and map the caller name & groups from token claims, set the caller name & group claim definition to `preferred_username` & `groups`.
[source, java]
----
@AzureAuthenticationDefinition(
    providerURI="#{openidConfigBean.tokenEndpointURL}",
    clientId="#{openidConfigBean.clientId}",
    clientSecret="#{openidConfigBean.clientSecret}",
    ...
    claimsDefinition = @ClaimsDefinition(
            callerGroupsClaim = "groups",
            callerNameClaim = "preferred_username"
    )
)
public class SecurityBean {
}
----

[[azure-ad-scope-validation]]
==== Azure AD scope validation
To disable the scope validation we can use the following MP Config property.

.Configuration Options
|===
| MP Config property | Description | Default value

| payara.security.openid.disableScopeValidation
| This property disable the scope validation for custom scope configurations
| false

[[keycloak-oidc-integration]]
=== Keycloak integration

Keycloak is Open Source Identity and Access Management Server, which is a OAuth2
and OpenID Connect(OIDC) protocol complaint. In this section, the basic steps 
are described to setup Keycloak OpenId provider.For more details about Keycloak 
configuration options, please visit to the official documentation:
https://www.keycloak.org/documentation.html

- Refer Keycloak https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/getting_started/index.html[getting started documentation] to run and setup keycloak.

- After Keycloak setup done, login to Keycloak admin console and add the new realm by pressing the **Add Realm** button: image:security-connector/oidc/keycloak/add-realm.png[Add Realm]

- Copy the OpenId endpoint configuration URL from endpoint section:
image:security-connector/oidc/keycloak/realm-endpoint.png[Realm Endpoint]

- Now add the **Role** that will be used by the application to define which users will be authorized to access the application.
image:security-connector/oidc/keycloak/add-role.png[Add role]

- Create the **Groups**:
image:security-connector/oidc/keycloak/create-group.png[Create Groups]

- Add the **User**:
image:security-connector/oidc/keycloak/add-user.png[Add User]

- After the user is created, set a new **password** for the user:
image:security-connector/oidc/keycloak/set-user-password.png[Set Password]

- Now map the user to roles. Click on **Role Mappings** tab and assign the roles to the user from the available roles:
