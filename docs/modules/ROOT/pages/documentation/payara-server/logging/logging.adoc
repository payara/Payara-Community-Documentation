= Logging
-------

Payara Server captures information about events that occur and records this
information using its logging mechanism into log files.

In a Payara Server domain, the information is logged into the following files
by default:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|==========================================================
|Instance |Log File Name and Location
|Domain Admin Server (DAS) |`domain-dir/logs/server.log`
|Standalone server instance |`instance-dir/logs/server.log`
|Cluster instance |`instance-dir/logs/cluster.log`
|==========================================================

If an instance is started using `-verbose` option, the instance keeps
running in the foreground and also logs information into the console.

Payara Server uses Java Logging (JUL) to format and output log records.
The default configuration file is
`domain-dir/config/logging.properties`.

Logging can be configured by `asadmin` commands (`set-log-attributes`,
`set-log-file-format`, `set-log-levels`, `delete-log-levels`, ...). It
can also be configured in Web Admin Console, in `Configurations`, under
the section `Logger Settings` - as on the following picture:

[[access-logging-max-file-size]]
== Access Logging Max File Size


Both Payara Server and GlassFish Open Source Edition provides different ways 
to rotate access log files. On top of that, Payara Server allows access log file 
rotation based on file size. 

`Max File Size` option provides a way to change the file size at which the Payara 
Server rotates the access log file. This option accepts an integer value specifying 
the maximum size of the log file, after which a file rotation will occur. 
If the value for this option is set to 0 rotation is disabled.

[[using-web-admin-console]]
=== Using the Admin Console

To configure `Max File Size` option using Admin Console:

image:logging/max_file_size.png[Max File Size]

[[using-asadmin-utility]]
=== Using an `asadmin` command

Use the following command to set maximum size for access log files:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set configs.config.server-config.http-service.access-log.maximum-file-size=5000000
----

[[access-logging-date-stamp-property]]
== Access logging date stamp property


The date stamp for access logs can be configured. When the new property is set to true, only the files that are rotated at the end of the day will be date stamped, whereas when the property is false, the file being written has the date stamp appended.


[[notification-logging]]
== Notification Logging Service


Payara Notification Logging Service captures information about events which come 
from other services, such as the JMX Monitoring Service, the HealthCheck service 
or the Request Tracing service and stores it into a log file.

All the generated logs are stored in _server.log_ by default. But, it is possible to configure the Log Notifier to output to a 
separate log file. More information on Log Notifier can be found on the 
xref:/documentation/payara-server/notification-service/notifiers/log-notifier.adoc[the Log Notifier].

If Log Notifier is configured to use a separate log file, the default log file 
can be found at:

[cols=1,options="header"]
|==========================================================
|Log File Name and Location
|`domain-dir/logs/notification.log`
|==========================================================

Payara Notification Logging Service uses its own collection of logging 
properties that is stored in a configuration file. By default logging properties 
file can be found at:

[cols=1,options="header"]
|==========================================================
|Logging Properties File Name and Location
|`domain-dir/config/logging.properties`
|==========================================================

[[configuring-log-file-rotation]]
==== Configuring Log File Rotation

By default log rotation is set to rotate when the log file reaches 2 
Megabytes(MB). Nonetheless, there are number of ways log rotation can be 
configured. Size of file at which the log rotates can be changed, it can be set 
to rotate at date change, rotate when time limit is reached and, finally based on 
maximum number of history files. Further details about these options will be 
explained in the following section:

[[daily-log-rotation]]
== Daily Log Rotation

Log file rotation keeps log files manageable and organized, as old log files are automatically deleted when they pass a given threshold, instead of staying on the system and eventually running the system out of disk space. Log file rotation still allows you to access previous logs, but its unlikely that you would need a log file older than a couple weeks.

[[Enabling-daily-rotation]]
=== Enabling daily rotation

image:logging/daily-log-rotation.png[Daily rotation config]

By default a size rotation of 2mb is used for logs in Payara Server Community, meaning no log files will be deleted until the size limit is reached and a new log is made at midnight.

Payara Server Community also has a number of rotation conditions which can be changed in the admin console.

* Time - Daily, weekly, monthly or even hourly log rotation.
* Size - Logs are rotated when they exceed a certain limit.
* Number - Maximum number of enteries in a log file.

image:logging/log_rotation_settings.png[Log rotation settings]

Which allows you to change how the logs are rotated to your needs and can be combined with daily log rotation. Enabling daily log rotation and setting a limit on the number of logs to keep will keep a certain number of days of logs before the oldest log file gets deleted at midnight.




Use the following command to enable or disable compression of log files on 
rotation:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-log-attributes fish.payara.enterprise.server.logging.PayaraNotificationFileHandler.compressOnRotation=true
----


[[ansi-coloured-logs]]
== ANSI Coloured Logging

Payara Server now supports using ANSI colours when running in verbose mode.

To enable ANSI colours using the `asadamin` tool:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-log-attributes com.sun.enterprise.server.logging.UniformLogFormatter.ansiColor=true
----

NOTE: This is enabled by default on Linux and Mac from Payara 5.181.


[[compression-of-log-files-on-rotation]]
== Compression of log files on rotation


Both Payara Server and GlassFish 4.0 Open Source Edition provide an option
to rotate logs files using a configurable interval (given either by the size of
the log file or by time elapsed). On top of that, Payara Server Community can be
configured to compress rotated files automatically. This is done
transparently, so  it is still possible to view  log entries that are using the
the log viewer in the Web Admin Console.

[[using-web-admin-console]]
=== Using the Web Admin Console

When log rotation is configured, you can turn on compression of rotated
files in the `Logger Settings` section, by ticking the `Compress on Rotation`
checkbox:

image:logging/compress_on_rotation.png[Compress on Rotation enabled]

[[using-asadmin-utility]]
=== Using an `asadmin` command

Use the following command to enable or disabled the automatic compression
of log files on rotation:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-log-attributes com.sun.enterprise.server.logging.GFFileHandler.compressOnRotation='true'
----

[[view-the-log-files-in-the-admin-console]]
=== View the log files in the Admin Console

The log files can be viewed in Admin Console in the same way as if they
were uncompressed. The only difference is that the filename name ends with
the `.gz` extension and it takes much longer to open them and display their
contents.

This is an example how the *Log Viewer* may visualize 3 compressed
log files:

image:logging/zipped_logs.png[Log Viewer with compressed log files]

[[json-log-formatter]]
== JSON Log Formatter


Besides ULF and ODL logging formats available also in _GlassFish 4_,
Payara Server Community provides additional JSON format. With this format, every
line in the log output is formatted as a JSON string. The log records
can be then easily parsed by a JSON parser for further data processing.

To enable the JSON formatter using the Admin Console, just select `JSON`
from the list of Logging Formats, either for `Console` or `Log File`:

image:logging/json_config.png[JSON format configuration in Web Console]

The following administration command will enable the JSON formatter:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-log-attributes com.sun.enterprise.server.logging.GFFileHandler.formatter='fish.payara.enterprise.server.logging.JSONLogFormatter'
----

Once the JSON formatter is enabled, the log file may look similar to this sample:

image:logging/json_example.png[Example log file with JSON format]

[[add-an-underscore-prefix]]
=== Add an underscore prefix

_Since Payara Server 5.182 and 4.1.2.182_

The following administration command will add the underscore prefix to field names in JSON Formatter:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-log-attributes fish.payara.deprecated.jsonlogformatter.underscoreprefix=true
----

By default, `fish.payara.deprecated.jsonlogformatter.underscoreprefix` property value is false.
Once underscore prefix enabled, all JSON fields should be prefixed with underscore, similar to this sample:

image:logging/json_underscore_prefix_example.png[Example log file with the underscore prefix in JSON fields]

[[additional-fields]]
=== Support for Additional Fields
_Since Payara Server 5.2020.5_

The JSON Log Formatter also supports the definition of additional fields through the parameters property. This
includes logging out the contents of a map.

You can set these additional fields via the `LogRecord.setParameters` method, like so:

[source, java]
----
LogRecord lr = new LogRecord(Level.INFO, "some message");
lr.setParameters(new Object[]{Collections.singletonMap(correlationIdKey, correlationIdValue)});
logger.log(lr);
----

[[log-to-file]]
== Log To File


Similar to `Log to Console` option available in both GlassFish 4.0 Open Source 
Edition and Payara Server. `Log to File` option will provide a way to enable 
and disable logging to a file in Payara Server Community. When disabled this should help 
to minimize disk usage. This option will be more accommodating if Payara Server 
is running in cloud environment where disk space is scarce. 

[[using-web-admin-console]]
=== Using the Admin Console

To configure `Log to File` option using Admin Console:

image:logging/log_to_file.png[Log to File enabled]

[[using-asadmin-utility]]
=== Using an `asadmin` command

Use the following command to enable or disabled logging to a file:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-log-attributes com.sun.enterprise.server.logging.GFFileHandler.logtoFile=false
----


[[multiline-mode-for-logging]]
== Multiline Mode for Logging


When Multiline mode is enabled, the log message body is printed on a new
line after the message header for each log record. This will lead to a
more friendly format that allows an easier reading.

It is possible to enable Multiline mode using the Web Console:

image:logging/multiline.png[Multiline mode in the Web Console]

To enable the Multiline mode using the `asadmin` tool:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-log-attributes com.sun.enterprise.server.logging.GFFileHandler.multiLineMode='true'
----

After the Multiline mode is enabled, the log messages will look similar
to this sample:

image:logging/multiline_example.png[Multiline mode in the Web Console]
