[[overview]]
1. Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~

This page provides instructions on how to build the Payara Server's source code.

[[prerequisites]]
2. Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build and run Payara Server, your environment must be set up with the following:

* Oracle JDK 7 Update 65 or later, or Oracle JDK 8 Update 20 or later.
* Maven 3.3.9 or above
* Git
* A `JAVA_HOME` environment variable pointing to the JDK install location (e.g. /home/user/jdk1.8.0_45/)
* A `PATH` environment variable that has a pointer to the Java binaries (JAVA_HOME/bin)

You can also optionally add the Maven _bin_ folder to the `PATH` environment variable as well, and the documentation will assume that you have done so.

[[configuring-maven]]
3. Configuring Maven
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using JDK 7, you will need to increase the heap size and _PermGen_ size to prevent the build process from running out of memory.

Create a `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable and set it as:

----
-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m
----

If you are using JDK 8, _PermGen_ has been replaced by _Metaspace_, which can increase its maximum size on its own, so you only need to increase the heap size:

----
-Xmx1024m
----

[[getting-the-source-code]]
4. Getting the Source Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To download the Payara Server's source code, open a terminal or Git Bash window, navigate to the directory you would like the source code to be downloaded to, and run `git clone https://github.com/payara/Payara.git`.

This will download the Payara Server's source code, and initialise git, in a directory called _Payara_.

5. Building Payara Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With your Git Bash or terminal window, navigate into the downloaded _Payara_ directory, and run:

----
mvn clean install
----

This will build Payara and run the integrated GlassFish unit tests. To save a bit of time, you can skip these tests by appending the _skipTests_ flag to the install command like so:

----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----

[[building-payara-micro]]
6. Building Payara Micro
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since 164, Payara Micro is included as part of the default build. As it depends on modules of Payara Server, it can't be built on its own. To build Payara Micro:

----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----

After the build has completed, the Payara Micro jar can be found in the target directory at:

----
appserver/extras/payara-micro/payara-micro-distribution/target/
----

[[building-payara-microprofile]]
Building Payara Microprofile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Payara Microprofile is built as part of Payara Micro. To build Payara Microprofile, you can run:

----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----

Payara Microprofile can be found in its target directory at:

----
appserver/extras/payara-micro/payara-micro-microprofile-distributions/target
----

[[additional-build-profiles]]
Additional Build Profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a number of additional Maven build profiles:

----
mvn clean install
mvn clean install -PBuildExtras
mvn clean install -PQuickBuild
----

[cols=",,,",options="header",]

|Payara Version |clean install |-PBuildExtras |-PQuickBuild

|Payara Server (Web Profile) |✓ |✓ |

|Payara Micro |✓ |✓ |
|Payara Microprofile |✓ |✓ |
|Payara Embedded | |✓|
|Payara Embedded (Web Profile) | |✓|
|=======================================================================

To save time on builds, you can also add the flag _skipTests_:

----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----

This will cut out all build tests so will save quite a bit of time.
