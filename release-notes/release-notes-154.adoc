Release Highlights
------------------

This release brings us back in line with GlassFish 4.1.1, with the benefit of all our additional fixes and enhancements from our previous releases, as well as a few more. Of particular interest in this release:

* Up to date with GlassFish 4.1.1.
* Removal of the dependency on .NET Framework 3.5, allowing Payara to be used with .NET Framework 4.
* The _payaradomain_ domain will now use an embedded Derby database for its default datasources (_domain1_ is unchanged to retain drop-in replacement viability).
* You can now set DISABLED as a JMS Broker type, allowing you to disable the OpenMQ Broker.
* Setting size-based log rotation to 0 will now turn it off.

In line with our https://github.com/payara/Payara/wiki/General-Info#naming-strategy[naming strategy], our version number has also been extended for this release to reflect the fact that we are up to date with GlassFish 4.1.1.

* https://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH-21426[GLASSFISH-21426 - Application deployment fails when DataSourceDefinition annotation is used within an EJB inside a war.]
* https://github.com/Pandrex247/Payara/commit/87b5e56f5584743568a40c546d9b7353cd8213e5[fix enforcer version of the javadoc-jdk8+ profile activation]
* https://github.com/Pandrex247/Payara/commit/9d4b676aecf61ab2e3e4e5716400919f993c1465[fixed redundant null check caught by findbugs for an earlier commit]
* https://github.com/Pandrex247/Payara/commit/fe015d0fc30ce59a54d37d1c8c51f7b71d8ff023[In case of JDK 9, java.logging loading sun.util.logging.resources.logging resource bundle and java.logging module is used as the cache key with null class loader.So we are adding a null check]
* https://github.com/Pandrex247/Payara/commit/c1f008d2a8596e96fa53e8b7286dd6250ec59b87[As per servlet spec 3.1, when Request.setCharacterEncoding(String enc) is called, the call should be a no-op if request input parameters have already been read or if getReader() has been called. However, at present, check is there only in case of use of reader and no check if parameter has been read by a different method call (e.g by calling getParameter()). This seems to be a regression introduced during Grizzly 2.0 integration in revision 46674. Changes have been made to check if parameters have been processed/read too. character encoding will not be set if either parameters have been reader or reader is being used.]
* https://github.com/Pandrex247/Payara/commit/46bba102abd3749ae3c0d742119ffe442790819b[EjbDescriptor abstract class implements JndiNameEnvironment and WritableJndiNameEnvironment. For some of these methods, though there is a generic implementation (For example via CommonResourceDescriptor), these methods still needs to be implemented in a specific way within EjbDescriptor abstract class to get the expected behavior whenever these methods are invoked in EjbDescriptor's context. To ensure the same, a new unit test is being introduced within source workspace, namely EjbDescriptorInheritedMethodImplementationTest,which basically ensures following two things: All methods defined in JndiNameEnvironment and WritableJndiNameEnvironment have a direct implementation within EjbDescriptor abstract class and all these methods are marked final in EjbDescriptor to ensure that sub-classes of EjbDescriptor don't override these methods accidentally, possibly causing unexpected behavior.]
